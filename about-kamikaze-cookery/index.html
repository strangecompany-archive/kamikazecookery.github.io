<p>Three geeks. Cooking. With science.</p>

<p>And explosions.</p>

<p>Described as &ldquo;Top Gear with food and without that twat Clarkson&rdquo; (by one of our mates, admittedly), we&rsquo;re putting the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; back into &ldquo;food&rdquo;. Which means we&rsquo;re making &ldquo;funood&rdquo;. And lots of it.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re taking cutting-edge &ldquo;molecular gastronomy&rdquo; techniques and explaining them with inept cookery and sweary stick figures. We subject traditional cookery - whether that&rsquo;s a Gordon Ramsey recipe or irrational beliefs about &ldquo;sealing meat&rdquo; - to rigorous, sort-of scientific testing. And, we teach you how to cook good food. With Science.</p>

<p>Also, we sometimes soak ourselves in apple juice, burn ourselves with hot metal, blow things up or nearly starve to death trying to live on a diet invented by hippies.</p>

<p>In Season 0 of KKCook (we index <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)">properly</a></em>), we mythbust herbal teas and preheated ovens, test out blowtorches, blenders, and celebrity chef cookbooks, try to reduce our food miles (then realise it&rsquo;s pointless), and teach you how to cook a perfect steak with a vacuum cleaner, a thermometer and a blowtorch.</p>

<p>Cookery. Now with Science. Sort of.</p>

<p>Watch.</p>

<p>(At the very least, you&rsquo;ll get to see us hurt ourselves.)</p>

<h3 id="hugh">Hugh</h3>

<p><img src="https://kamikazecook.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Hugh-253x300.jpg" alt="Hugh" /></p>

<p>Hot from the fast-paced world of <a href="http://www.strangecompany.org">playing games all day</a>, Kamikaze Cookery&rsquo;s Executive Producer has no cooking qualifications whatsoever. Not even a Domestic Science <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcse">GSCE</a>.</p>

<p>But he <em>has</em> cooked a full-scale Roman banquet, attempted to buy liquid nitrogen for culinary purposes, built his own laboratory water bath, and read everything Heston Blumenthal has ever written. Literally.</p>

<p>If you want <em>even more</em> Hugh for some reason, he&rsquo;s also the curator of the <a href="http://www.mmomeltingpot.com">MMO Melting Pot</a>.</p>

<h3 id="alex">Alex</h3>

<p><img src="https://kamikazecook.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Alex-270x300.jpg" alt="Alex" /></p>

<p>Alex attempted to tell us that he wasn&rsquo;t a great cook when we started filming KKCook. But we told him to shut up and hold this blowtorch.</p>

<p>Now, armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of beer and chillis and more Wikipedia pages than porn sites on his browser history, he is Kamikaze Cookery&rsquo;s Stuff That The Other Two Don&rsquo;t Know About expert.</p>

<h3 id="paul">Paul</h3>

<p><img src="https://kamikazecook.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Paul-300x270.jpg" alt="Paul" /></p>

<p>Paul informs us that he&rsquo;s an excellent cook. None of us have ever eaten anything he&rsquo;s made, although Hugh has watched him make a Shepherd&rsquo;s Pie from mince three days past its sell-by date.</p>

<p>But he rants like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_hicks">Bill Hicks</a> on a caffeine overdose (and with an English accent and none of the Goatboy rubbish), he&rsquo;s sceptical of any cookery innovation that&rsquo;s less than 8,000 years old, and he&rsquo;s got a sweet hat.</p>
