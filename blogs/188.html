  <p>Salmon&rsquo;s one of the best-known things to sous-vide, with low-temperature cooked salmon having attracted a lot of attention from people like Heston Blumenthal (or Dr B, as <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com/films/2">we like to call him</a>.) And for good reason - ultra-low-temperature sous-vide salmon is pretty stunning stuff.</p>

<p>There appear to be two seperate approaches in sous-vide cooking toward fish - Thomas Keller&rsquo;s, who advocates cooking fish at (comparatively) high temperatures for very short times, and the more conventional approach where the fish is taken slowly to its target temperature. From experience, I&rsquo;m a fan of Keller&rsquo;s approach, particularly on oily fish.</p>

<p>h2. The conventional approach to salmon</p>

<p>Douglas Baldwin&rsquo;s got a full recipe for salmon Mi-Cuit in <a href="http://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html">his sous-vide guide</a></p>

<p>, but here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remove the salmon&rsquo;s skin</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Leave it in very salty water for 10 minutes ( to avoid albumen leaching out)</p></li>

<li><p>Season with salt and pepper</p></li>

<li><p>Cook it between 101Â°F (38.5 C) and 126Â°F(52 C), depending on how rare you want your fish, according to his chart of times against thickness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This produces a very rare, tender salmon. You need to cook very good, very fresh salmon for this recipe - like all sous-vide fish, sous-vide salmon tends to intensify any fishy smells present, which can be really quite unpleasant if the fish is going off.</p>

<p>h2. A La Thomas Keller</p>

<p>This is an experimental approach I haven&rsquo;t played with too much, but you might find it interesting.</p>

<p>To get a salmon cut sous-vide that feels a fair bit firmer, and possibly a bit fresher, try this approach. You&rsquo;ll also get more variation in cooking throughout the fish, which is certainly extremely nice in Keller&rsquo;s mackerel recipes. Since salmon is a similar fish in many ways, I&rsquo;d expect this to work well. Let me know if you try it! (And I promise to try it myself soon).</p>

<p>Prepare the salmon as with Douglas&rsquo;s guide, but alter the cooking times - assuming a piece of salmon about an inch thick, cook it for 13 minutes (yes, that&rsquo;s a VERY short time) at 61 degrees C. Note that like Douglas&rsquo;s Mi Cuit, this will NOT be pasturised, so don&rsquo;t serve it to anyone who will keel over if they contract food poisoning!</p>

<p>h2. The Safe Approach</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with well-cooked salmon.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re serving to the elderly, children, or people who are otherwise immune-compromised, cook your salmon at 60 degrees C for the times listed in <a href="http://amath.colorado.edu/%7Ebaldwind/sous-vide.html">Douglas&rsquo;s guide</a>.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t be as meltingly tender, but it&rsquo;ll still be tasty!</p>

<p>Again - <strong>let me know your experiences with salmon</strong>!</p>
