  <p>Chicken doesn&rsquo;t have a great reputation as a meat. People call it bland. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>

<p>During my time off from Kamikaze Cookery, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of cooking, and learning a lot of new stuff. Some of it isn&rsquo;t directly applicable to everyday living, like knowing the national dish of Laos (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larb">larb</a>, a minced meat salad - nicer than it sounds). Other bits, though, really are - notably having had time to thoroughly go through many of my neglected recipe books.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be sharing a fair bit of this stuff over the next months, but right now I want to talk about what might be my favourite dish of all from a year&rsquo;s testing - grilled chicken.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;grilled&rdquo; here, I mean grilled on a grill pan, a solid chunk of metal with ridges that you put on a stove, or potentially a barbeque. (Personally I&rsquo;m using a seriously battered Le Creuset cast iron model) Top-down grills, which the Americans amongst us would call &ldquo;broilers&rdquo;, have rather seriously different cooking qualities (although they&rsquo;re ace for sausages). But a ridged grill cooks fast and delivers lots of gorgeous searing on the meat, meaning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Maillard reactions</a> are a go, for that amazing caramelised crunchiness contrasting with the hot, fresh, tasty meat.</p>

<p>h2. Thigh FILLETS are the win.</p>

<p>Chicken breasts don&rsquo;t have a great reputation amongst the cookerati, which I think is slightly unfair. However, for a simple grill, you really want the flavourful, mixed dark and light, slightly fatty meat of a thigh. Grilled chicken breast is not only more expensive but also less tasty.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem with that - a whole thigh takes forever to grill, and is a bit of a dicy proposition even if you&rsquo;re using a thermometer. My one undercooked-chicken FAIL of the last year was courtesy of some stovetop-grilled chicken thighs - you&rsquo;ve got to watch hot and cold spots, which even induction cookers and cast iron can produce, you&rsquo;ve got to watch cooking all the way through the meat, and you&rsquo;ve got to watch the wierd thermal dynamics around the bone. In short, whole chicken thighs are great for all-over cooking in stews or ovens, but suck donkey balls for grilling.</p>

<p>However, most UK supermarkets at least now stock thigh fillets. They&rsquo;re damn good value (about four pounds for 500g of free-range high-quality thighs from Sainsburys in the UK), they taste gorgeous, and they&rsquo;re thin, so they cook extremely fast on a grill. Most of them are skinless, but the grilling process gives so much flavour it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>You could fillet your own thighs, of course. I could peel tomatoes for ragu too, but I can&rsquo;t usually be arsed to do either. They&rsquo;re about comparable levels of pain in the ass.</p>

<p>(Finally, one neat tip if you cook sous-vide. Grilled chicken breast is a two-minute job if you cook the breast at low temperature - and by &ldquo;low&rdquo; we mean 60 degrees centigrade, a la <a href="http://amath.colorado.edu/%7Ebaldwind/sous-vide.html">Douglas Baldwin&rsquo;s guide</a>. ONce they&rsquo;re done, simply slap them on the grill for a minute each side - the only way to get really tasty grilled breast. Make up a really good caesar dressing, grab some anchovies and some crispy lettuce, and you&rsquo;ve got the basis of a world-beating grilled chicken salad. )</p>

<p>h2. &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; is the name of the game in grilled chicken recipes.</p>

<p>Solo, grilled chicken thighs aren&rsquo;t bad. But the heat and the fat means that they take up appropriate flavours like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe.</p>

<p>My vote for best meal I&rsquo;ve made all year goes to Nigel Slater&rsquo;s chicken thighs with thyme leaves. Just rub the thigh fillets with good olive oil and fresh thyme - don&rsquo;t even bother stripping it from its branches, just stick sprigs of it on there - then grill. The smell is incredible - one of the few meals that works much better if you&rsquo;re eating it where you&rsquo;re cooking.</p>

<p>He also recommends balsamic vinegar, onions, or French mustard as tastes to go with grilled chicken. I&rsquo;d also suggest lemon or lime - grilled lemon chicken is a classic, of course - to cut through the smoke and bring out high notes to the taste, or maybe even white wine - you could try just heating the pan hot then almost basting the chicken with it every couple of minutes. Barbeque sauce, provided it&rsquo;s good stuff, or Moroccan tastes like cumin also work a treat.</p>

<p>h2. Fat, fat, fat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all about the fat in recipes for grilled chicken. Chicken thighs already have quite a bit, of course, and this is a good reason to keep the skin on if you can get the skin-on fillets. (The other reason, of course, is that chicken skin is gorgeous).</p>

<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be wanting to add some serious fat content in there. Olive oil rubbed into the chicken tastes fantastic in an &ldquo;oh my god, I&rsquo;m in an Italian tourism advert&rdquo; sort of way. Butter, either rubbed on, plonked on after, or both, gives it a rich, expensive feel. And cream or creme fraiche makes a great base for a sauce, contrasting nicely with the spare feel of the grilled chicken and picking up all the grilled, charred flavours.</p>

<p>Any other tips for grilled chicken?</p>
