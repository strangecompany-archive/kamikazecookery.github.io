  <p>Sous-vide is absolutely the best way to cook steak. After a couple of years of using it, I&rsquo;m 100% convinced that the perfect steak is a sous-vide steak, no question. It&rsquo;s tender, it&rsquo;s juicy, it&rsquo;s cooked all the way through to a completely even colour and texture, there are no worries with undercooking or overcooking. And to add to all that, it&rsquo;s about as complex to cook as a Pot Noodle.</p>

<p>Kamikaze Cookery&rsquo;s first ever episode was about improvising a sous-vide setup to cook <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com/films/2">perfect steak</a> . But assuming you want to go a bit beyond that - perhaps you&rsquo;ve got your own sous-vide machine, even - how do you make your steak really kick ass?</p>

<p>h2. Cut isn&rsquo;t that important, but quality is.</p>

<p>I think that fillet steak is overrated, particularly for sous-vide cooking. It&rsquo;s very nice and very tender, but so is rump steak cooked sous-vide. And wheras other cuts will tend to stiffen up a bit if cooked on a grill or fried, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that problem when you&rsquo;re using a sous-vide water bath.</p>

<p>However, sous-vide can&rsquo;t save a crappy piece of meat. If it&rsquo;s not aged properly, or the cow was stressed when it died, or had an uninteresting diet, that&rsquo;s going to stay with you.</p>

<p>So, for preference, I&rsquo;d always select a really good rump steak from a farm I know (easier to do than you&rsquo;d think - just hit the local farmer&rsquo;s market) over a supermarket fillet steak. And if I&rsquo;ve got to shop in the supermarket, I&rsquo;ll take their top-end rump over a medium-quality fillet every time.</p>

<p>h2. Temperature</p>

<p>Under 60 degrees, every time. You may well like beef well done, but if you do, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t assist you, because that just seems wierd to me.</p>

<p>Thomas Keller recommends 59.5 degrees Centigrade (139 F) , which will give you a pinkish bit of meat, rather than one with any bloody juices. Personally I&rsquo;ll tend to drop a few degrees from that into the 56 to 57 range (130 to 135), which produces a slightly bloody but very, very tender and juicy piece of meat.</p>

<p>Remember, to speed up your setup time, use your shiny electric <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com/blogs/185/www.kamikazecookery.com/blogs/177">yellow kettle</a> - or other kettle, as you prefer - to boil about half the volume of water your bath takes. It&rsquo;ll reduce your setup time from an hour&rsquo;s heating to close to nil.</p>

<p>Cooking times? As always, follow <a href="http://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html">Douglas Baldwin&rsquo;s charts</a>
 - he&rsquo;s got a section on beef.</p>

<p>h2. Seasoning</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of fancy seasoning on steak, unless it&rsquo;s being cooked by someone a lot more competent than me. If Grant Achatz wants to serve me prime sirloin with a hint of tarmac, I&rsquo;ll trust his judgement. But when I&rsquo;m cooking the darn thing, the best seasoning I&rsquo;ve ever found for a sous-vide steak is salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Fresh-grind your rock salt and pepper on both sides, stick it into the vacuum sealer, and Bob&rsquo;s your uncle. With some searing when it comes out, this noticably improves the taste over unseasoned steak, whilst also kicking the ass of any other seasoning combination I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t skip the pepper - you need both for a perfect steak.</p>
