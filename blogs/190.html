  <p>SO you want to buy your coffee cheaply? Who doesn&rsquo;t? And certainly, buying K-Cups (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keurig">Kuerig coffee pod system</a>&rsquo;s coffee pods, for those not in the know) can be horrendously expensive, particularly if you&rsquo;re buying straight from the manufacturer. After being ripped off for $1 or more per pod, buying the cheapest k cups you can seems like a good idea.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s all too easy to end up buying horrible discount pods from no-name suppliers, too, as many online guides will recommend. We didn&rsquo;t want to go that way.</p>

<p>Overall, the cheapest price for any K-Cup on the &lsquo;net is about $.37 a cup - however, the quality you&rsquo;ll get for that price is nothing short of shocking, and not in a good way.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s a quick guide to the best K-Cups money can buy, collated from the hundreds and hundreds of reviews on <a href="http://www.singleservecoffeeforums.com">http://www.singleservecoffeeforums.com</a> (which is a fantastic resource, by the way):</p>

<p>(If you&rsquo;re considering a K-Cup machine, you might be interested in our article on whether single-serve coffee machines <a href="165.html">are worth it at all</a> before you buy)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Van Houtte Eclipse Extra Bold</strong>: Virtually no-one dislikes this dark, strong, smooth coffee, although if you like your coffee very mild it may not be to your taste. It&rsquo;s scarcely cheaper to buy on Ebay than it is from the official site, which does indeed offer pretty excellent value: $.65 per cup for 24 cups, a very good price for a small order. If you wanted to get a bigger order, Amazon&rsquo;s your best bet, offering 108 of the same K-Cups for $.55 each - worth it if you&rsquo;re sold on this coffee in the long term.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Coffee People Treehugger</strong> Smooth, balanced medium roast that goes well with cream as well as black. A very simple recommendation for buying here - go straight to Amazon and get the 2-pack of 24 K-Cups each for $.48 per cup. It&rsquo;s more expensive on the official site and anywhere else I looked.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Tully&rsquo;s French Roast</strong> A bit of a controversial cup - a lot of people love it but a few really don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a very high roast with a smoky taste and a long aftertaste. If you&rsquo;re a member, it&rsquo;s actually cheapest to buy this from the main Keurig site in the 80-cup size, coming in at $.49 per cup. Otherwise, Amazon sells a 2-pack of 24-cups for $25, coming in at just above $.50 per cup.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any other recommendations on great K-Cups or good places to buy them?</p>
