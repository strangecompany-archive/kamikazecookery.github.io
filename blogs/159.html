  <p>No it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>However, it is on extended hiatus. Basically, my intention was to pick up KKC again last year, figure out a format that meant we could produce it in a reasonable time and, as the orcs of today say, GOOOOG!</p>

<p>Then Death Knight Love Story://www.deathknightlovestory.com happened.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, my day job is as an animation director. During the first year of KKC, I&rsquo;d been taking a sabbatical to work with Real Film - hence, KKC. However, in 2009 I got back to work, and decided to write a script for a short film to get started making motion capture projects.</p>

<p>I showed it to a few people. Rather famous people. And they showed it to some even more famous people, like Joanna Lumley, Jack Davenport, Anna Chancellor and Brian Blessed. Unexpectedly, they thought it was fantastic, and agreed to come work on it for a pittance.</p>

<p>At that point, all other projects got shoved off the table.</p>

<p>However, one day soon DKLS (as it is known) will be done, and I&rsquo;ll have some free time. And at that point I intend to do more stuff with KKC. NOt sure WHAT more stuff - a full series might be unlikely, but we might find a way to do it - but more stuff.</p>

<p>So, apologies for the wait. We ain&rsquo;tn&rsquo;t dead. We have no idea what we&rsquo;re doing, but we&rsquo;re still intending to do something.</p>
