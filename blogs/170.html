  <p>Kettles - great, but irritatingly loud sometimes. Kettle manufacturers seem to have cottoned onto that fact, and are now advertising more and more quiet electric kettles, with &ldquo;quiet boil&rdquo; features and more. But what actually affects the quietness of an <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com/blogs/160?&lt;p&gt;First">electric kettle</a> thing to check is actually not the kettle, but its surroundings. If it&rsquo;s very loud, it&rsquo;s probably because the vibrations from the kettle boiling are causing a larger area to vibrate too. Is its base touching any other household items, which might be vibrating in turn? A good trick to quickly quieten it down is to place something soft to damp vibrations from the kettle - try putting it on a dishcloth or teatowel, then boiling your water and seeing how the noise is affected.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s a cordless kettle on a base, a little bit of kitchen towel between the kettle and the base might also damp vibrations nicely.</p>

<p>If you want to go the whole hog and buy a quieter kettle, there are a number of ways manufacturers can make their kettles cheaper. Double-walled kettles, which have a double wall in the same way as a thermos flask or some of the more expensive (and useful) <a href="164.html">cafetieres</a>, will insulate noise in exactly the same way it insulates heat - in both cases, the design gives a buffer of lower-density air or vaduum between the higher-density metals or plastics, and both air and heat are transmitted by vibrations. In general, a kettle that&rsquo;s cooler to the touch should also be quieter.</p>

<p>Many kettle reviews complain that so-called quiet kettles aren&rsquo;t, or that unquiet kettles are. If they&rsquo;re trying to make the kettle quieter by design of the shape of the element or even the kettle, they&rsquo;ll be running into very, very complex fluid dynamics problems, which frankly British Aerospace have enough trouble solving. Any solutions at a home applicance level, unless they&rsquo;re from a very impressive manufacturer (if <a href="http://www.dyson.co.uk">Dyson</a> makes a quiet kettle, listen up), are likely to be a bit unreliable. Having said that, if you buy a hot water heater-style kettle (read <a href="160.html">our warnings on those</a>, but they do have some advantages), the totally different way they heat water from a kettle should make them close to silent.</p>

<p>(We do have another piece on how to choose a <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com/blogs/171">silent kettle</a> if you&rsquo;re still determined, though.)</p>

<p>Finally, a lower-powered kettle won&rsquo;t necessarily be a quieter kettle. No matter how slowly you push energy into the kettle, the molecules still have to reach the same temperature to boil, and that&rsquo;s still going to involve the same state changes and gas bubbles, which in turn mean vibration. You might be better to buy a more powerful kettle and just make noise for less time!</p>
