  <p>When I first heard of the idea of boiling chicken, I was pretty aghast. I mean, <a href="161.html">grilled chicken, abso-bloody-lutely</a>, pan fry, sure - gorgeous chicken here we come. Steamed chicken breast isn&rsquo;t very interesting, but it&rsquo;s very nutritious. But boiling chicken? I envisoned something dull, tough, flavourless, and with all the nutrients swimming around in the pan.</p>

<p>But actually, there are a few reasons why you might want to boil chicken, or at least do something approximating to boiling it.</p>

<p>h2. If you need to do something with cheap chicken legs</p>

<p>Chicken is one of my favourite foods on earth, but more than any other meat, it really depends on how well the animal was grown. Linda Dick grass-fed free-range birds have a beautiful flavour with nothing done to them. But cheap-ass bottom-of-the-supermarket battery-farmed chicken? Ugh. It&rsquo;s a bit like eating slightly off tofu.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;ve been poor a fair few times, and during one of them I figured that boiling chicken thighs - well, not boiling them exactly, more poaching them - was about the only way to make them palatable.</p>

<p>Make up a fairly flavourful stock - you can do this pretty cheaply with a couple of cut onions, carrots, and a fairly serious amount of vegetable stock cubes and some wine vinegar or ideally wine (you can use off wine from a couple of days ago). Immerse your cheap thighs in it, and heat the entire thing until it&rsquo;s just bubbling. Now leave it to go for a few hours.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;ll have some chicken thighs with actual flavour soaked into them, no matter how rubbish the initial bird was.</p>

<p>h2. If you&rsquo;re wanting to make a stew or stock</p>

<p>Of course, people always say that you should make a chicken stock with a chicken carcass. That&rsquo;s great if you happen to have one lying around. But if not, I&rsquo;ve found that frozen chicken pieces make a fairly acceptable substitute fresh stock.</p>

<p>Fill a great big stock pot with water. Add carrots, celery and onion. Dump half a dozen frozen chicken pieces in there - yeah, I know people say you should defrost them, but frankly if you&rsquo;re going to boil the darn thing for a couple of hours there&rsquo;s no bacteria on earth that can survive that (even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_cereus">Bacillus Cereus</a>, infamous for surviving high temperatures, won&rsquo;t survive more than 20 minutes of boiling). Bring to the boil, then lower to a simmer, and leave to stew for one and a half to two hours. (Ignore people who tell you to cook stocks for eight hours - it IS possible to overcook a stock). Skim the scum that rises to the surface - using this method, you&rsquo;ll get a lot of it.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;ll have some great stock, far better than anything you&rsquo;ll get from a store, and you&rsquo;ll have loads of extremely well-cooked chicken, which won&rsquo;t be too flavourful, but will taste OK if it&rsquo;s shredded and fried (see below).</p>

<p>h2. If you want a low-hassle way to get some shredded chicken</p>

<p>Like I say above, there&rsquo;s no reason you can&rsquo;t take frozen chicken straight to boiled chicken that I know of. If you&rsquo;re wanting some shredded chicken for a stir fry or similar, and you&rsquo;ve got some chicken in the freezer, just take it out and boil it for a while (at a gentle boil, not a rolling boil), where a while&rsquo;s about 45 minutes or more - check it to make sure it&rsquo;s done before you serve, obviously.  It&rsquo;ll be a bit dry and it&rsquo;s not the best way to cook chicken, but unless you&rsquo;ve <a href="133.html">got a sous-vide water bath</a>, it&rsquo;s probably the most convenient.</p>

<p>Once they&rsquo;re cooked, just take your bits of chicken out - they should shred really easily, and they&rsquo;ll be perfectly acceptable deep-fried or used in fried rice.</p>
