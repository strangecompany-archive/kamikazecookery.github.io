  <p>Hello folks! We&rsquo;re still here (sometimes) and I hope that you are, too. Cooking is still taking place, and sometimes we blog about it.</p>

<p>You might recall that about three years ago <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com/films/5">I performed a magnificent destruction of Jamie Oliver and all that he stands for</a>. I&rsquo;ve spent quite a lot of time over the intervening three years improving on his methods. Recently, over on my other blog, I combined everything together into the finest <a href="https://gominokouhai.dreamwidth.org/244850.html">meatball lasagne el diablo</a> you have ever seen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had Italian people tell me that my recipe is not a proper ragu, but I don&rsquo;t care, it&rsquo;s still better than Jamie&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Who remembers <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com/films/2">the perfect steak</a>? We love the perfect steak, but many people (read: nearly everyone except Hugh) claimed that sous-vide was too fiddly. It turns out that you can <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/cook-your-meat-in-a-beer-cooler-the-worlds-best-sous-vide-hack.html">do it very easily in a cool box</a>. I shall be trying this as soon as I get hold of a cool box. More <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/03/how-to-sous-vide-steak.html">general details on sous-vide</a> are available from the same site. They also have a brilliant sans-sous-vide recipe for <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/03/perfect-pan-seared-steaks-recipe.html">doing a steak in the pan, the way our ancestors did</a>, if that&rsquo;s more your thing. My friend at <a href="https://m62food.blogspot.com/">Northern Food</a> <a href="https://m62food.blogspot.com/2012/01/trying-to-cook-perfect-steak-volume-4.html">has been having a great deal of fun practising this</a>.</p>

<p>They seem to like their steak at that Serious Eats site. Here&rsquo;s an article on <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/the-food-lab-more-tips-for-perfect-steaks.html">why you should salt steak, as long as you do it right</a> (hint: do it <em>well</em> before you cook the thing).</p>

<p>I hope these are helpful to someone. What other food sites (other than KKC of course) are on your required reading lists?</p>
