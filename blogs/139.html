  <p>So, what&rsquo;s going on with Kamikaze Cookery, then?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve gone a bit quieter lately, as you&rsquo;ve probably noticed. That&rsquo;s a) because I&rsquo;m on holiday, and b) because we&rsquo;re starting to ramp up for the next KKC release.</p>

<p>The next KKC release(es) won&rsquo;t be another series, but a special feature, somewhere between one to three parts. We&rsquo;re aiming to shoot it in May or early June, and it should be with you pretty soon after.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also been looking into prettiness - I&rsquo;ve got a new camera, the rather wonderful HF-10 from Canon, which will bring our shooting technology into the 21st century from the late &lsquo;90s where our last camera left us, and we&rsquo;ve got an agreement to borrow some lighting kit, so everything should look a lot prettier.</p>

<p>As far as format goes, we&rsquo;re looking at making each episode shorter, which should reduce the workload, and also increase our viewership. The big problem with KKC at the moment is that it&rsquo;s basically a full-time job for about 4 months to produce the scale of series we did for Season 0, and whilst our viewers are all, without exception, lovely, they&rsquo;re also not numerous enough to support that financially! We&rsquo;d need about 10-20 times more viewers to support that level of production.</p>

<p>In addition, we&rsquo;ve all got other projects (which has been the reason for the quiet patch, too). Notably, I&rsquo;m (as the editor and director) engaged in developing a bunch of different technology for the <a href="http://www.strangecompany.org">day job</a> at the moment, and we&rsquo;re intending to start on a new series there soon, so once again, that cuts into KKC time.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re not entirely sure what&rsquo;s going to happen series-wise. Our current plan is to make a &ldquo;special&rdquo; in May and see how it goes! Hopefully the additional quality will get us a whole bunch of new viewers, and we can see what happens from there.</p>

<p>(In other news, we&rsquo;ll also be releasing the second DVD from Season One at the same time, with the usual commentary and extra material).</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up! If we blog infrequently in the next while, it&rsquo;s because time that could have been blogging time is going into production - we&rsquo;ll try and get you some stills, some concept stuff, some ideas of what we&rsquo;re working on, as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any ideas for increasing our audience or making the series faster - we&rsquo;d like to make more!</p>
