  <p>The problem with electric kettles is clearly that they&rsquo;re a bit staid. Boring. Run of the mill. What you want is a kettle that&rsquo;s different. A kettle that stands out from the crowd, a kettle that will emphasise your feminine side. But not something stovetop-based, of course. Something actually practical. A pink electric kettle.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that we ended up doing some research around here for our <a href="160.html">tips on electric kettles</a>, and in the course of that, we found out that such things exist.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/La-Cafetiere-Electric-Kettle-Pink/dp/B0009Q0LI6"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21N97DZNGEL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="La Cafetiere Electric Pink Kettle" /></a> The first name that leaps out of Google when you look for a pink kettle is La Cafetiere, best known for frankly rather overpriced french presses. (Although any <a href="164.html">cafetiere</a> is a bargain compared to most other ways of making coffee)</p>

<p>The La Cafetiere kettle looks lovely - it really does, even someone who&rsquo;s decidedly out of the target market like me would admire the smooth, understated looks. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s where the good news ends. According to users, it&rsquo;s not a picnic in the kitchen at all. There&rsquo;s no water level indicator, you can&rsquo;t fill it through the spout, and the lid tends to get extremely stuck. If you&rsquo;ve absolutely got to have the best design, go for this one, but otherwise, I&rsquo;d say avoid.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Electric-water-kettle-concealed-element/dp/B002WN2HVS"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ch3Y77wYL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="IBIS Electric Water Kettle" /></a></p>

<p>If you really want the most pink you can possibly get, a Bodum kettle may be the way forward - specifically the IBIS pink. The design&rsquo;s kinda blocky and ugly, and the reviews are decent but not outstanding, with users not complaining but not singing its praises either. But it&rsquo;s really, really electric pink - and if you want your decor to really put the &ldquo;electric&rdquo; in electric tea kettle, there&rsquo;s really no other choice. (Beware, though - it has no specific rating for its wattage, so whilst it claims a fast boil, that could be twice as long as the Kenwood).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kenwood-Traditional-Style-Stainless-kettle/dp/B000MWW05Y"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GCbx2-yBL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Kenwood Traditional Style Pink Kettle" /></a> Last but not leaste, the Kenwood Traditional Style Pink Kettle. It&rsquo;s pretty clear that Kenwood&rsquo;s designers were aiming straight at &ldquo;cute&rdquo; here - it&rsquo;s almost impossible to resist the urge to start going on about what a &ldquo;wuvvly cuwte widdle thing&rdquo; it is. Now, personally, if I wanted cute I&rsquo;d get a kitten, but in the right kitchen this thing could look brilliant. Users are very happy with it too - it&rsquo;s very quiet, it&rsquo;s 3kW for really fast boiling, it&rsquo;s got a water level indicator to avoid damaging the environment by heating half an ocean every time you want a cuppa.</p>

<p>Overall? Get the Kenwood if you want pink and cute. Get the Bodum if you don&rsquo;t like the Kenwood. Get the La Cafetiere if you prize design above functionality.</p>
